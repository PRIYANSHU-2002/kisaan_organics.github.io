# kisaan_organics.github.io

This is a prototype website for a company that produces and sells organic fruits, vegetables, dairy products, honey, manure, etc. across different parts of India under the brand name 'Kisaan Organics'. This is an individual project made by me in the 5th semester of my course. The site has various pages pertaining to different informations about the company and its products such as a products page, a page summarising the company's aim, a page informing about various stores of the company across the country. This project is mainly built using HTML and CSS only, but it contains a bit of Javascript implementation also. The site is live at:
